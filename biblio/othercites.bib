abstract = {A general type of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is discussed to show that the physical quantities such as complex susceptibility of magnetic or electric polarization and complex conductivity for electric conduction are rigorously expressed in terms of time-fluctuation of dynamical variables associated with such irreversible processes. This is a generalization of statistical mechanics which affords exact formulation as the basis of calculation of such irreversible quantities from atomistic theory. The general formalism of this statistical-mechanical theory is examined in detail. The response, relaxation, and correlation functions are defined in quantummechanical way and their relations are investigated. The formalism is illustrated by simple examples of magnetic and conduction problems. Certain sum rules are discussed for these examples. Finally it is pointed out that this theory may be looked as a generalization of the Einstein relation.},

abstract = {The moment generating function of a set of stochastic variables defines the cumulants or the semi-invariants and the cumulant function. It is possible, simply by formal properties of exponential functions, to generaiize to a great extent the concepts of cumulants and cumulant function. The stochastic variables to be considered need not be ordinary c-numbers but they may be q-numbers such as used in quantum mechanics. The exponential function which defines a moment generating function may be any kind of generalized exponential, for example an ordered exponential with a certain prescription for ordering q-number variables. The definition of average may be greatly generalized as far as the condition is fulfilled that the average of unity is unity. After statements of a few basic theorems these generalizations are discussed here with certain examples of application. This generalized cumulant expansion provides us with a point of view from which many existent methods in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics can be unified.{\textcopyright}1962 The Physical Society of Japan},

abstract = {The concept of coherence which has conventionally been used in optics is found to be inadequate to the needs of recently opened areas of experiment. To provide a fuller discussion of coherence, a succession of correlation functions for the complex field strengths is defined. The nth order function expresses the correlation of values of the fields at 2n different points of space and time. Certain values of these functions are measurable by means of n-fold delayed coincidence detection of photons. A fully coherent field is defined as one whose correlation functions satisfy an infinite succession of stated conditions. Various orders of incomplete coherence are distinguished, according to the number of coherence conditions actually satisfied. It is noted that the fields historically described as coherent in optics have only first-order coherence. On the other hand, the existence, in principle, of fields coherent to all orders is shown both in quantum theory and classical theory. The methods used in these discussions apply to fields of arbitrary time dependence. It is shown, as a result, that coherence does not require monochromaticity. Coherent fields can be generated with arbitrary spectra.},

abstract = {A free-carrier absorption mechanism, in which a photon transition is accompanied by an elastic interface-roughness scattering event, is considered for a few representative quantum well structures. Interface-roughness scattering determines the low-temperature mobility in undoped narrow quantum wells such as those used in infrared lasers. It is found that in spite of the contribution due to scattering to higher subbands, the absorption coefficient for TE-polarized light remains appreciably less than the semiclassical value at shorter wavelengths. The implications of these results for the recently proposed interband far-infrared and terahertz lasers based on “W” antimonide structures are discussed. In the case of roughness-assisted absorption of TM-polarized light, transitions forbidden by symmetry and exclusion arguments become allowed. However, the largest second-order contribution relative to first-order intersubband absorption tends to occur at wavelengths where the total absorption coefficient is rather small.},

The absorption line shape, the decreasing frequency with increasing wire diameter, and the polarization dependence of the reflectivity, all indicate that this resonance is due to an intersubband absorption resulting from quantum-confinement effects.

The energies of these five peaks agree well with the predicted values for intersubband transitions, thereby validating our model of quantum confinement in bismuth nanowires. We also compare the measured absorption in free-standing wires to the absorption of wires inside an alumina template obtained from an analysis of transmission and reflection measurements using a reverse effective-medium theory. Close agreement between the energies of the largest absorption peak is found by the two methods. The weaker absorption peaks were not observed in the spectrum of wires embedded in alumina.},

We study selection rules for the processes. Some singularities in the Raman spectra are found and interpreted.

@article{Liu2010,
abstract = {Reducing the thermal conductivity of nanowires may enhance their already exciting efficiency of thermoelectric energy conversion. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires could be significantly decreased by patterning (or etching) induced roughness of the nanowire surfaces. The type, amplitude, and wavelength of the surface roughness all have profound effects, and the thermal conductivity could be reduced more when the wavelength is smaller or the amplitude is larger. Such an effect of roughness on the thermal conductivity is furthermore found to be coupled with the effects of nanowire cross-sectional size and length. Typically, the roughness effect is more prominent in longer and larger nanowires.},
