Localization of the electrons was found to be responsible for the exciton recombination time measured in the vicinity of the metal-to-insulator transition. Measurement of the exciton recombination time as a function of the energy allowed for determination of the critical energy of the mobility edge attributed to the conduction band electrons. The mobility edge energy obtained in this way demonstrates intersection with the Fermi level energy at the critical disorder corresponding to the metal-to-insulator transition.},

The surface immediately after growing the second strained Si layer on SiGe with 20{\%} Ge content is found to be flat with about 1.1nm root-mean-square roughness. However, the crosshatched surface with the 7.8nm roughness develops during subsequent SiGe growths, which is slightly less than the 10.3nm value for SiGe without inserted Si layers. Another important issue of consideration is that inserting the strained Si layers leads to increased interaction among dislocations as shown by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy.

The commonly used model of interface roughness scattering approximates the well potential by infinitely high barriers. By using SiGe as an example, we demonstrate that this approximation strongly overestimates interface roughness scattering for narrow quantum wells. Our calculations show that the low-temperature mobilities of two-dimensional hole gases in SiGe and of electrons in strained Si quantum wells are limited by interface roughness scattering for well widths below 20-50 Angstrom. The discussed effect of finite barrier heights on carrier scattering should be considered in transport investigations of materials such as GaAs/AlGaAs and Si/SiGe, when the well width is in the range of 100 Angstrom or below.},

Using temperature dependent analysis of effective mobility, quantitative information about the influence of the roughness could be obtained directly on the device. The sidewall and top surface drain current components were estimated from the total drain currents of different fin width conditions. Using a conventional mobility model, it was possible to fit the gate voltage and temperature dependence of sidewall and top surface mobilities. This procedure allowed the contribution of the surface roughness scattering to be quantified with nondestructive characterization. Significant differences were observed for sidewalls and top surface. In the specific case under study, surface roughness scattering on sidewalls was about three times stronger than on top surface for n-channel FinFETs, whereas it remained similar for p-channel ones. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We study the dependence of the mobility and diffusion thermopower on the temperature T, carrier density n and QW width L. The exchange and correlation effects are taken into account using different approximations for the local-field correction (LFC). It is shown that, for the values of parameters employed and wide QWs with L {\textgreater} 125 {\AA}, the AC phonon scattering is dominant for T {\textgreater} 35 K and the effects of homogenous background charged impurity scattering (BIS) on the thermopower are remarkable. For thin QWs with L {\textless} 55 {\AA}, the mobility and diffusion thermopower are mainly determined by interface-roughness scattering (IRS).

The devices were fabricated on silicon-on-insulator wafers utilizing wafer bonding, which enabled us to use heavily doped metallic back gate. We observe mobility enhancement effects at symmetric gate bias at room temperature, which is the finger print of the volume inversion/accumulation effect. An asymmetry in the mobility is detected at 300 K and at 1.6 K between the top and back interfaces of the Si well, which is interpreted to arise from different surface roughnesses of the interfaces. Low temperature peak mobilities of the reported devices scale monotonically with Si well thickness and the maximum low temperature mobility was 1.9 m2/V s, which was measured from a 16.5 nm thick device. In the magneto transport data we observe single and two sub-band Landau level filling factor behavior depending on the well thickness and gate biasing. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This allowed with accuracy up to several percents from relation Rc=cPF/eH to determine the impulses of the extreme cross-section of the Fermi surface of holes in T-point of the Brillouin zone, anisotropy of the Fermi surfaces of holes in T.

abstract = {A free-carrier absorption mechanism, in which a photon transition is accompanied by an elastic interface-roughness scattering event, is considered for a few representative quantum well structures. Interface-roughness scattering determines the low-temperature mobility in undoped narrow quantum wells such as those used in infrared lasers. It is found that in spite of the contribution due to scattering to higher subbands, the absorption coefficient for TE-polarized light remains appreciably less than the semiclassical value at shorter wavelengths. The implications of these results for the recently proposed interband far-infrared and terahertz lasers based on “W” antimonide structures are discussed. In the case of roughness-assisted absorption of TM-polarized light, transitions forbidden by symmetry and exclusion arguments become allowed. However, the largest second-order contribution relative to first-order intersubband absorption tends to occur at wavelengths where the total absorption coefficient is rather small.},

To provide a fuller discussion of coherence, a succession of correlation functions for the complex field strengths is defined. The nth order function expresses the correlation of values of the fields at 2n different points of space and time. Certain values of these functions are measurable by means of n-fold delayed coincidence detection of photons. A fully coherent field is defined as one whose correlation functions satisfy an infinite succession of stated conditions. Various orders of incomplete coherence are distinguished, according to the number of coherence conditions actually satisfied. It is noted that the fields historically described as coherent in optics have only first-order coherence. On the other hand, the existence, in principle, of fields coherent to all orders is shown both in quantum theory and classical theory. The methods used in these discussions apply to fields of arbitrary time dependence. It is shown, as a result, that coherence does not require monochromaticity. Coherent fields can be generated with arbitrary spectra.},

The type, amplitude, and wavelength of the surface roughness all have profound effects, and the thermal conductivity could be reduced more when the wavelength is smaller or the amplitude is larger. Such an effect of roughness on the thermal conductivity is furthermore found to be coupled with the effects of nanowire cross-sectional size and length. Typically, the roughness effect is more prominent in longer and larger nanowires.},

The exponential function which defines a moment generating function may be any kind of generalized exponential, for example an ordered exponential with a certain prescription for ordering q-number variables. The definition of average may be greatly generalized as far as the condition is fulfilled that the average of unity is unity. After statements of a few basic theorems these generalizations are discussed here with certain examples of application.

abstract = {A general type of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is discussed to show that the physical quantities such as complex susceptibility of magnetic or electric polarization and complex conductivity for electric conduction are rigorously expressed in terms of time-fluctuation of dynamical variables associated with such irreversible processes. This is a generalization of statistical mechanics which affords exact formulation as the basis of calculation of such irreversible quantities from atomistic theory. The general formalism of this statistical-mechanical theory is examined in detail. The response, relaxation, and correlation functions are defined in quantummechanical way and their relations are investigated. The formalism is illustrated by simple examples of magnetic and conduction problems. Certain sum rules are discussed for these examples. Finally it is pointed out that this theory may be looked as a generalization of the Einstein relation.},

The transitions exhibit resonant eneries of 152 and 121 meV respectively, full width at half-maximum linewidths as narrow as 10meV at room temperature, and an oscillator strength of 12.2.

Expressions for the acoustic phonon limited electron momentum relaxation rates, considering the inelasticity of the electron–acoustic phonon interaction in wurtzite (WZ) and zincblende (ZB) structures, are given. Numerical calculations of acoustic phonon limited µ, Sd and $\kappa$e, presented as a function of temperature, thickness and the electron concentration of the NWs, bring out the importance of the piezoelectric coupling in the two systems. The properties studied within the elastic scattering approximation, usually used in analyses to explain acoustic-phonon limited transport, are found to be underestimated for both WZ and ZB structures. Calculations of room temperature µ, Sd and $\kappa$e including impurity, polar optical phonon and surface roughness scatterings, indicate polar optical phonons (impurities) to be the dominant sources of limiting the thermoelectric properties in ZnO (GaN) NWs. The mobility value for 10nm GaN NW is in agreement with experimental data of Huang et al. [2] [Y. Huang, X.F. Duan, Y. Cui, C.M. Lieber, Nano Lett. 2 (2002), 101].

@article{Arenas2015,
abstract = {We calculate the electrical resistivity of a metallic specimen, under the combined effects of electron scattering by impurities, grain boundaries, and rough surfaces limiting the film, using a quantum theory based upon the Kubo formalism. Grain boundaries are represented by a one-dimensional periodic array of Dirac delta functions separated by a distance “d” giving rise to a Kronig–Penney (KP) potential. We use the Green's function built from the wave functions that are solutions of this KP potential; disorder is included by incorporating into the theory the probability that an electron is transmitted through several successive grain boundaries. We apply this new theory to analyze the resistivity of samples S1, S2, S7 and S8 measured between 4 and 300K reported in Appl. Surf. Science 273, 315 (2013). Although both the classical and the quantum theories predict a resistivity that agrees with experimental data to within a few percent or better, the phenomena giving rise to the increase of resistivity over the bulk are remarkably different. Classically, each grain boundary contributes to the electrical resistance by reflecting a certain fraction of the incoming electrons. In the quantum description, there are states (in the allowed KP bands) that transmit electrons unhindered, without reflections, while the electrons in the forbidden KP bands are localized. A distinctive feature of the quantum theory is that it provides a description of the temperature dependence of the resistivity where the contribution to the resistivity originating on electron-grain boundary scattering can be identified by a certain unique grain boundary reflectivity R, and the resistivity arising from electron-impurity scattering can be identified by a certain unique ℓIMP mean free path attributable to impurity scattering. This is in contrast to the classical theory of Mayadas and Shatzkes (MS), that does not discriminate properly between a resistivity arising from electron-grain boundary scattering and that arising from electron-impurity scattering, for MS theory does not allow parameters (ℓIMP, R) to be uniquely adjusted to describe the temperature dependence of the resistivity data. The same data can be described using different sets of (R, ℓIMP); the latter parameter can be varied by two orders of magnitude in the case of small grained samples d{\textless}ℓ, and by a factor of 4 in the case of samples made out of large grains d{\textgreater}ℓ (where ℓ is the bulk mean free path at 300K). For samples d{\textgreater}ℓ, the increase of resistivity is attributed not to electrons being partially reflected by the grain boundaries, but to a decrease in the number of states at the Fermi sphere that are allowed bands of the KP potential; hence the reflectivity required by the quantum model turns out to be an order of magnitude smaller than that required by the classical MS theory. For samples d{\textless}ℓ, the resistivity increase originates mainly from Anderson localization induced by electron grain boundary scattering from disordered successive grains characterized by a localization length of the order of 110nm and not from electrons being partially reflected by grain boundaries; the outcome is that the reflectivity required by the quantum theory turns out to be about 4 times smaller than that required by the classical MS theory.},

abstract = {Carrier mobility is one of the most important parameters of any semiconductor material, determining its suitability for applications in a large variety of electronic devices including field effect transistors (FETs). Today the capabilities of modern planar Si FET devices are almost exhausted and researchers are seeking either new device architectures or new materials. Here we report an extremely high room temperature (at 293K) 2D hole gas (2DHG) drift mobility of 4500cm2V−1s−1 at a carrier density of 1.2×1011cm−2 obtained in a compressively strained Ge quantum well (QW) heterostructure, grown by an industrial type chemical vapor deposition system on a standard Si(001) substrate. The low-temperature Hall mobility and carrier density of this structure, measured at 333mK, are 777,000cm2V−1s−1 and 1.9×1011cm−2, respectively. These hole mobilities are the highest not only among the group-IV Si and Ge based semiconductors, but also among p-type III–V and II–VI materials. The obtained room temperature mobility is substantially higher than those reported so far in strained Ge QW heterostructures and reveals a huge potential for further applications of this material in a wide variety of electronic devices.},

abstract = {The inversion layer electron mobility in n-channel In0.53Ga0.47As MOSFET's with HfO2 gate dielectric with several substrate impurity concentrations (∼1×1016cm−3 to ∼1×1018cm−3) and various surface preparations (HF surface clean, (NH4)2S surface clean and PECVD a-Si interlayer with a HfO2 gate dielectric) have been studied. The peak electron mobility is observed to be strongly dependent on the surface preparation, but the high field mobility is observed to be almost independent of the surface preparation. A detailed analysis of the effective mobility as a function of electric field, substrate doping, and temperature was used to determine the various mobility components (surface roughness, phonon, and coulombic scattering limited mobility components). For the substrates with high doping concentration, the electron mobility at low vertical electric field is dominated by Coulomb scattering from the substrate dopants, whereas, for lower substrate doping the Coulombic scattering is dominated by the disorder induced gap states. Low temperature measurements were used to determine the surface roughness scattering and phonon components. The results show that room temperature mobility of In0.53Ga0.47As surface channel MOSFETs with HfO2 gate dielectric at high electric field is limited primarily by remote phonons whereas the Al2O3 gate dielectric is limited by surface roughness scattering.},

abstract = {We calculate the electrical conductivity of a metallic sample under the effects of distributed impurities and a random distribution of grain boundaries by means of a quantum mechanical procedure based on Kubo formula. Grain boundaries are represented either by a one-dimensional regular array of Dirac delta potentials (Mayadas and Shatzkes model) or by its three-dimensional extension (Szczyrbowski and Schmalzbauer model). We give formulas expressing the conductivity of bulk samples, thin films and thin wires of rectangular cross-sections in the case when the samples are bounded by perfectly flat surfaces. We find that, even in the absence of surface roughness, the conductivity in thin samples is reduced from its bulk value. If there are too many grain boundaries per unit length, or their scattering strength is high enough, there is a critical value Rc of the reflectivity R of an individual boundary such that the electrical conductivity vanishes for R{\textgreater}Rc. Also, the conductivity of thin wires shows a stepwise dependence on R. The effect of weak random variations in the strength or separation of the grain boundaries is computed by means of the method of correlation length. Finally, the resistivity of nanometric polycrystalline tungsten films reported in Choi et al. J. Appl. Phys. (2014) 115 104308 is tentatively analyzed by means of the present formalism.},

abstract = {In this work, we applied the magnetoresistance (MR) characterization technique on n-type FD-SOI devices from a 14nm-node technology. A notable advantage of MR is that it can probe the sub-threshold region, where Coulomb scattering influence is unscreened, while classical methods are validated to the strong inversion regime. At first, we discuss the influence of series resistance depending on gate bias, gate stack and temperature in this technology. Secondly, for long channel devices, we show that Coulomb scattering plays no significant role below threshold voltage at room temperature, in spite of the presence of a high-k/metal gate stack. MR-mobility ($\mu$MR) measurements were also performed in interface coupling conditions in order to further assess the role of the high-k/metal gate stack on transport properties and to analyze back bias induced mobility variations, depending on temperature range. Finally, the comparative study of low field effective mobility ($\mu$0) and $\mu$MR shows that critical gate length of mobility degradation can be overestimated by using $\mu$0 at low temperature due to a lack of ability of Y-function method to capture unscreened Coulomb scattering.},

abstract = {Electron mobility is investigated in sub-20nm-thick InGaAs channels, sandwiched between different gate oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, HfO2) and InP as substrate, using physics-based numerical modeling. Effects of body thickness downscaling to 2nm, different gate oxides, and surface orientation [(100) and (111)] are examined by including all electron valleys and all relevant scattering mechanisms. We report that ultra-thin (111) Al2O3–InGaAs–InP devices offer greater electron mobility than (100) devices even in the extremely-thin channels. Furthermore, ultra-thin (100) InGaAs devices outperform SOI in terms of electron mobility for body thicknesses above ∼4nm, while (111) InGaAs channels are superior to SOI for all body thickness values above ∼3nm. The study of different gate oxides indicates that HfO2 is the optimum gate dielectric regardless of device orientation, offering a mobility improvement of up to 124{\%} for (111) and 149{\%} for (100) surface orientation, when compared to the initial Al2O3–InGaAs–InP structure. The (111) orientation offers improvement over (100) device irrespective of the body thickness and gate oxide material, with the highest difference reported for SiO2, followed by Al2O3 and HfO2.},

The predomination regions of different phonon modes and the phonon confinement effect on the scattering rate for intrasubband transitions are found. It is shown that the consideration of phonon confinement leads to mobility increase.},

abstract = {The transport properties of carriers in semiconducting graphene nanoribbons are studied by comparing the effects of phonon, impurity, and line-edge roughness scattering. It is found that scattering from impurities located at the surface of nanoribbons, and from acoustic phonons are as important as line edge roughness scattering. The relative importance of these scattering mechanisms varies with the temperature, Fermi level location, and the width of the ribbons. Based on the analysis, strategies for improvement of low-field mobility are described.},

@article{Gold1990,
abstract = {We present a theoretical investigation of the electronic properties of a quasi-one-dimensional electron system at very low temperature. For a cylindrical quantum wire the electron-impurity interaction and the electron-electron interaction is calculated for a two-subband model. Our analytical results for the electron-impurity and the electron-electron interaction are in good agreement with the exact results for our model. Analytical results for the band bending due to the filling of the lowest subband are evaluated. Within our analytical results we discuss various aspects of the electronic properties of the semiconductor quantum wire: screening (intrasubband and intersubband plasmons), shallow impurity states (screened and unscreened), and mobility (ionized-impurity scattering and interface-roughness scattering). Analytical expressions are given for the dispersion of plasmons, the binding energies of shallow impurities, and the mobility. Our results on intersubband plasmons are compared with experiments.},
